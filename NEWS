User-Visible Changes in python-spake2

* Release 0.7 (12-May-2016)

COMPATIBILITY BREAK

This release changes the way passwords are turned into scalars, and the way
the final transcript hash is formatted. Hopefully this will be compatible
with the proposed SJCL (Javascript) implementation described in the comments
of https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/pull/273 . Applications which use
python-spake2-0.3 or earlier will not interoperate with those which use 0.7
or later: the session keys will never match.

pypy3 support has been dropped, until pypy3 handles python3.3 or later (it
currently implements the equivalent of python3.2).

python-spake2 now depends on the "hkdf" package. Tox and py.test are now used
for running tests. setup.py has been switched from distutils to setuptools.


* Release 0.3 (22-Sep-2015)

Use the faster "M=N" blinding factors for SPAKE2_Symmetric, instead of
running two sessions in parallel and combining the results. This gets the
same speed and message size as the asymmetric (SPAKE2_A/SPAKE2_B) approach,
and is probably safe (see README for the security proofs).


* Release 0.2 (08-Apr-2015)

Use Ed25519 group/parameters by default (improves speed, security, and
message size). Note that both sides must use the same parameter set for
compatibility.


* Release 0.1 (13-Feb-2015)

Initial release. Includes SPAKE2_A/SPAKE2_B, and SPAKE2_Symmetric. Provides
three integer-group parameter sets (Params1024, Params2048, Params3072).
